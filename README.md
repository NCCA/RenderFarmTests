# Render Farm Tests

This repo is being used to collate test scenes and scripts as well as the custom Qube Jobs and scripts used for the NCCA render farm. 

It will also contain examples of command line rendering and notes / examples on how to use and render basic scenes. 

See the named sub folders and readme files for examples.
