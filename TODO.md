# TODO

This is a non exhaustive list of things to do and think about. Will most likely not make sense to anyone but Jon :-)

## Tests 

1. Renderman
2. Houdini (Mantra / Solaris)
3. Arnold

- Time / test per file submission (i.e. one file per frame) vs bulk / in file multi frame to figure best practice

- Test folder locations / maya scene setup

- Pre post submission scripts

- Hserver tests and shutdown.
