# Renderfarm Update

This document contains the basic workplan and estimated time span for the renderfarm upgrade project. 


## Outline 

A present the current farm doesn't work due to upgrades with different DCC tools and the change of python versions from 2.7 to 3.9 in the DCC tools. 

As Qube is primarily written in Python this is a problem as our current tools and systems are incompatible with each other.
